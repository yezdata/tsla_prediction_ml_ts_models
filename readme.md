> **Quick Summary:** A comparative analysis exploring the predictability of Tesla (TSLA) stock prices. This project contrasts traditional econometric models (ARIMA/VAR) against modern Machine Learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost), incorporating a unique sentiment indicator derived from Elon Musk's tweets (2010–2025) via FinBERT.

## 📊 Key Results: Regression & Classification

The evaluation reveals that short-term stock returns exhibit low predictability. Simple models often outperformed complex architectures, suggesting a low signal-to-noise ratio in the dataset.

| Model Category | Best Model | Metric | Performance | Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Time Series (R)** | **ARIMA (Univariate)** | RMSE | **0.0381** | Beats multivariate ARIMAX/VAR; proves exogenous variables added noise. |
| **ML Regression** | **Random Forest** | RMSE | **0.0382** | Matches ARIMA performance; beats complex boosters (XGBoost/LightGBM). |
| **ML Classification** | **GD Logistic Reg** | Accuracy | **57.4%** | Best capability to predict direction (Up/Down) rather than magnitude. |
| **Baseline** | Naive | RMSE | 0.0540 | All trained models successfully beat the Naive baseline. |

# Project Overview

1. **Analysis framework:**  
   - Analyze a large unique dataset to identify the best-performing models (ARIMA, VAR, basic ML models, etc.).  
   - Incorporate NLP assesed sentiment from Elon's tweets with 4 different levels - positive, negative, neutral or none (Elon didn't tweet about tesla)
   - Dataset also contains survey data representing spread between % of bullish or bearish investors, google trends data of search term "tesla", financial indicators (VIX, TSLA volume, SMA, ATR, stochRSI, MACD, ADX etc.)
   - Evaluate models on prediction accuracy metrics and visualizations.

2. **Prediction Approaches:**  
   - Implementing ARIMA or VAR with exogenous variables for improved accuracy, as pure endogenous approach might be less suitable when some of exogenous indicators (VIX, bulish bearish spread..) are not directly influenced by the target stock price.  
   - Try alternative basic ML methods to compare them with traditional time series models
   - Try to incorporate classification prediction task as predicting wheter log return will be positive or neutral / negative

## Part 1 (directory r/)
**Unconventional data, conventional models**
- Main programming language: R (python used to get FinBERT from HuggingFace)

- Project evaluates time-series models (ARIMA, ARIMAX, VAR, VARX) on unique data to get answer on hypothesis, that unique Elon Musk's tweets sentiment indicator data, volatility data and market sentiment data bring a lot of information to model predicting financial stock data. 
- I also assume, that usage of more features such as financial indicators would improve accuracy
- Projects uses different model architectures to assess different approaches and compare their evaluation metrics -> their performance.

## Part 2 (directory python/)
**Unconventional data, uncoventional models**
- Main programming language: Python

- Project aims to extend Part 1 of this project. Extension lies in using python instead of R to create machine-learning models and their prediction evaluations. Then compare traditional time-series models and these models to get result of perfomance on financial data.
- Part 2 also explores classification ML methods which cannot be directly compared to regression task models from Part 1
- Classification is based on predicting artificialy created binary variable, which takes on value 1 if stock log return went over some "significance" treshold (0.005)
- At the moment there is Gradient Descent Linear Regression and Gradient Descend Logistic Regression done, written from scratch.
- Projects also uses regression and classification Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost and LightGBM models.
- All models are trained recursively on rolling window -> walk forward prediction validation on same data
- LSTM is planned aswell.

- Best model **RandomForest** gets approximately same results as best model from Part 1 (univariate ARIMA)
- Most sofisticated models (XGBoost, LightGBM) perform the worst on these metrics, but visual inspection of predictions show they really capture the data patterns better than others
- Plots provided below show that some models performs well on visualized predictions even though their mean error shows otherwise (they might be penalized for their mistakes more than a model which predicts only Expected value of log return ~0)
- All models beat Naive model

- Models show accuracy slightly better than randomness (0.5) although **GD Logistic Regression** performs quite good on all metrics
- Weighted recall and precision indicate models have in weighted average limited ability to correctly identify all actual classes and when they predict some class, they are only moderately often correct
- Log Loss metric indicates models have limited confidence in their predictions
- On ROC AUC metric, models show relatively weak ability to differentiate between classes across different thresholds
- These models perform quite well on clasification prediction task given hard predictability of short horizon log return
  

### Short-term stock returns exhibit very low predictability. All tested models achieved only marginal improvements over basic mean of y or randomness, which is consistent with the known difficulty of short-horizon financial forecasting. Moreover, sentiment extracted from tweets does not provide strong predictive power in these settings.
- **Though regression models perform quite well on visualizations, metrics show they aren't really reliable**   
- **All models combined (classification and regression) show that in these settings, they are better in predicting the direction of future log return than the size of its change**
- **There aren't any sufficient significant patterns/relationships in this data finded, which when modeled with these models, could be reliably used to predict log return of TSLA. Regressor models show similar MSE to basic ARIMA of low order, which also by plot show weak oscilation around mean (~0) of the log return timeseries.**   

- **NOTE**:  
When trying also simple Decision Trees and Random Forest only with past values of log return (1-10 lags) to avoid using irelevant features (all of the used features also doesn't really show high abs corellation with y), results are similar, ofter worse
